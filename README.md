🚀 **Smart Home Remote and Voice Assistant – My Latest Project!**

Smart home systems can be expensive and complex to set up. So, I decided to build an **affordable, easy-to-use Smart Home Remote and Voice Assistant** using a **Raspberry Pi 4**.

💡 **What it does:**  
This system allows users to **control home appliances like lights and fans** using:
- 🎤 **Voice commands** via a microphone  
- 🌐 **Web interface** for remote access

With this setup, users can **turn appliances on/off from anywhere**, improving convenience and energy efficiency—no pricey gadgets needed!

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- Raspberry Pi 4  
- `speech_recognition` Python library (for interpreting voice commands)  
- Flask (for building the web interface)  
- Python (for logic and control)

This project shows how smart home automation can be **simple, cost-effective, and accessible to all**. Just a few tools and some creativity can go a long way! 💡🏠
