🚀 **Smart Home (Remote And Voice Assistance) – My Latest Project!**

Smart home systems can often be expensive and complex to set up. So, I set out to build an **affordable, easy-to-use Smart Home Remote and Voice Assistant** using a **Raspberry Pi 4**. 

💡 **What it does:**
This system allows users to **control lights and fans** using:
- 🎤 **Voice commands** via a microphone
- 🌐 **Web interface** for remote access

With this setup, you can **turn appliances on/off from anywhere**, making everyday tasks more convenient and improving energy efficiency—without the need for costly smart home devices.

🛠️ **Key Tech Stack:**
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Mycroft AI (for voice assistance)
- Python
- Web interface for remote control

This project proves that **smart home automation doesn’t have to break the bank**. It's simple, accessible, and highly functional. 💡🏠
